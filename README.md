1. Setup vagrant box and install chef-solo(please use basic boxes without preinstalled chef client) Download chef client from http://www.getchef.com/chef/install/ and install package. Download ChefDK and install http://www.getchef.com/downloads/chef-dk/
2. Configure knife With your favorite editor: create ~/.chef/solo.rb
log_level :debug
file_cache_path "/root/.chef/"
cookbook_path "/root/chef_cookbooks"
json_attribs â€œ/root/.chef/runlist.json"
Create files and folders mentioned in solo.rb config.

3. Download and install cookbooks (find and download nginx and iptables) from http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/ to "/root/chef_cookbooks"
Hint: Better to use git repos.
Navigate to nginx cookbook, it has dependencies you may see it in its metadata.rb file.
We will use Berkshelf to download dependent cookbooks
berks install
you should see bunch of cookbooks located in ~/ .berkshelf now we need to transfer them to our repo
berks package
Cookbook(s) packaged to /root/cookbooks/nginx/cookbooks-1399822646.tar.gz
tar -xf /root/cookbooks/nginx/cookbooks-1399822646.tar.gz -C /root/

4. Create run list which contain recipes from downloaded cookbooks.
To ensure that only the recipes that you want to test are tested, include them in the node's run list via a JSON file. It looks like this:
{
"run_list": ["recipe[nginx::default]", "recipe[iptables::default]"],
"nginx": {"default_root":"/usr/share/nginx/html"}
}
We will install nginx iptables and override default nginx root to match path defined in Ubuntu nginx package by default.

5. Run create run config for chef-solo and apply runlist to VM. This should install configure and launc nginx on port 80.
chef-solo -c /root/.chef/solo.rb
